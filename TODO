PRIORITY
Extract & remove test set from new unite release (and save the scripts to do this)
Weights and biases
Next sentence prediction
Masked language modelling (learning rate schedule...?)

LATER
Dimensionality reduction and visualization
Weights and biases
Expand predict.py with much more features

LAZY TASKS
Doing some experiments
Allow for loss curve when valid data is not available
Allow for other curves than just loss on training data?
Maybe print some of the results and mention that the 'full' are saved (instead of saving just everything.)
Check (again) known/total comparison
Ideally, you'd merge a dataframe prediction back to the original DataPrep object
Do something about the lazylinear layers
Apply for LISA (surf) server

RANDOM IDEAS
Add unusual bases to 'confident' classes as to make the model familiar with those
Approach the problem as a 'machine translation' task
Alternative weighted sampling methods (less extreme)
Label smoothing?
Sampling in next epoch based on performance in previous epoch
